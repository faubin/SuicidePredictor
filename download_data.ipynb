    "The data from County Health Ranking is tricky to download. The file name tend to be slightly different from year to year and state to state. The name of the files are not available on the webpages where they are linked. This code therefore uses a \"guessing\" approach which is highly inneficient. A sleeping command is executed in-between every download to avoid being blacklisted by the website. Reduce this time at your own risk. It may take several hours to download all files with the name \"guessing\" and the default 3 s wait time. To do:\n",
    "- allow to download the files from a \"know file\" list (this list is ont he repository already)\n",
    "- optimize the download process to reduce the \"guessing\"\n",
